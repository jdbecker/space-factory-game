# Space Factory Game

An automation-themed game in the vein of Satisfactory but set in space with an EVE style.

## Premise

The player starts with a single, small, simple ship and nothing else. They mine raw
minerals from asteroids and refine it into usable metals which they use to create many
things, such as:

- ships
- modules for ships/structures
    - tools
    - weapons
    - cargo
    - engine mods
    - etc
- structures
    - storage
    - refining more efficiently
    - ship construction
    - module construction
    - research
    - housing

Eventually the player will build habitat structures to appeal to immigrants. The player
can receive money trading with immigrants (or traders). The player can spend this money
to hire pilots from the immigrants, providing them a ship and a task, which they will
perform as long as their salary continues to be paid. Tasks like:

- mine raw materials
- ferry items/materials
- operate a structure
    - refine
    - research
    - consruction
- combat (protect me, join my wing)

Using all this, the player will eventually build their own little empire, buliding more
and more powerful ships, they will fit a more and more powerful fleet which they'll be
able to use to clear more and more powerful enemies from guarding the keys to unlocking
new technologies.
